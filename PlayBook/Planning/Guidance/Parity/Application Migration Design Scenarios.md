#Application Migration Design Scenarios#

In order to serve as a guide on the migration of your applications from an application architecture perspective, we focused on the application migration design for 2 scenarios: Rehost and Refactor.

- [Refactor Migration Scenario](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Planning/Guidance/Parity/Refactor%20Migration%20Scenario.md) - Covers the scenario that you are deploying new applications on China Azure, which you may have these applications already running on other cloud providers, and would like to look for solutions for a better and faster migration to China Azure.

- [Rehost Migration Scenarios](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Planning/Guidance/Parity/Rehost%20Migration%20Scenarios.md) - Covers the scenario for redeploying the application to a different cloud environment. This is to serve as a guide on the migration design for your applications or workloads that run on Global Azure, and to have them migrated to China Azure.

Let's move to the next section - [Performance](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Planning/Guidance/Performance.md).
