##Differences from an Administrator Perspective##

Deploying your application and administrating your Azure services on China Azure is similar to what you do on Global Azure. The fundamental difference is the address of the Azure portal. You can access China Azure through either one of the following ways:

- The classic portal ( https://manage.windowsazure.cn/ ),

- The new portal ( https://portal.azure.cn/ ) which is currently available in preview mode.

CDN on China Azure has **its own unified CDN management portal** . This portal will introduce some operational changes to CDN management if you are migrating from the Global Azure CDN. Please refer to [Content Delivery Network (CDN) Design](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Planning/Guidance/Parity/Rehost%20Migration%20Scenarios.md) for details.
