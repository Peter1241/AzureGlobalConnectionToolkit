##China Cloud Policies and Laws##

According to the "Internet Information Services" regulation, the "non-commercial Internet information service record management" regulation, and the other regulations promulgated by the Ministry of China, the government has enforced all non-commercial Internet information services to strictly follow the ICP (Internet Content Provider) registration and filing process.
 
In order to provide non-commercial Internet information services within the People's Republic of China, you should first perform the ICP filing procedures according to the law. Any organization that doesnâ€™t go through the ICP filing process shall not engage in providing non-commercial Internet information services within the People's Republic of China.
 
It must be noted that for any internet website without a filing record, the owner of the website will be fined or the site will have to shut down. In order for the website to be active and provide services within the People's Republic of China, the website must first have a filing record and its registered domain name must be resolved only to its registered IP address.

##Data Auditing##

Based on your ICP registered domain and hosting location, MIIT and related governmental authorities should within their respective areas of responsibility, and according to the law, implement supervision and management of your Internet content. They reserve the right to audit your web site by examining your servers and data, at your actual hosting location and at any time if needed.
