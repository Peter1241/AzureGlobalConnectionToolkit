##Global Azure and China Azure Services Asymmetry##

China Azure, or Mooncake, is a separate instance of Azure operated by 21Vianet. There are differences in the availability of Azure services, compared to that of Global Azure.
 
Below is a summary table based on service parity, essentially comparing Global Azure to Mooncake (Note: if there is difference, it is highlighted in red).
 
It should be noted that new services are still being launched. The following table is the information updated as of the end of Sep 2016. You should always refer to the latest services offered in Mooncake at www.azure.cn.
