## Introduction

In the world of digital retailing and booming cross-border e-commerce, all eyes are on China.  We have received unmatched interest for Azure in China and enjoyed triple digits revenue and utilization growth year over year. As of now, we are still the only Cloud platform provider in China with pervasive global footprint and have been regarded to be highly trustworthy. Many Global customers have shown interest to setup their cloud presence to China, they already may have a vast footprint on Public Azure and are looking towards rehost, refactor, and/or rebuild some/all of their applications or services to China using Azure China.
 
Azure China is the first sovereign cloud operated by a third party entity (21Vianet), and completely isolated from Public Azure.  The complexities and the unique internet environment and policies in China introduce many frictions when customers planning or working on such project  including policies (government), performance (networking), parity (services), and partner (ecosystem).

The team helps in end to end process by being involved right from assessment, proving, planning, implementing, and validating. In additional to support by escalations to China CAT team, we also in accountable to setup The Global Customer Migration Center, which is centered around Azure China as migration target, aims to provide customer a one-stop-shop for advisory and tools needed technically, legally and financially.
