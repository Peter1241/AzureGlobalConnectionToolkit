# AzureGlobalConnectionToolkit
The goal of Azure Global Connection Toolkit is to connect different national clouds and to eliminate the friction to migrate applications between the national clouds.

Typically, migration / integration between different Cloud environment has three phases:

1. **Plan**:
During this phase, users are required to investigate the differences between different
cloud environments e.g. Azure Global vs. Azure China/Azure Germany. Differences
in terms of costs and services parity, as well as risks, unfamiliarity and
uncertainty in the new environment, causes the time and efforts required for
migration planning to increase. 

2. **Validate**:
User
also required to validate if their services will be able to run in the targeted
environment. Usually we need to conduct proof of concept or lots of researches
in order to understand the limitations and constraints of the new environment.
The difficulties to get and use a trial account also block users from moving
ahead.

3. **Migrate**:
After
planning and validation have been completed, user needs to investigate how to
migrate/clone their current workloads to the new environment. The complexity of
technologies blocks user from performing a migration in short period of time.

In order to help users in each step, Azure Global Connection Toolkit offers two components:

- **Assessment Tool**:
Assessment
Tool is a quick and simple tool to generate report and to answer FAQ when
migrating Azure Services between different Azure cloud environments.
Information to be provided in the assessment report includes items such as
services parity, cost estimations and important considerations etc. The
assessment tool is a PowerShell Module to allow user to perform assessment on
their global Azure subscription to generate plans and validation reports to
assist their migration planning tasks.

- **CICD Tool**:
The
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) Tool is a quick and
simple tool to perform the actual migration through PowerShell scripts. For
example, you can leverage the CI/CD tool to migrate your VMs from Azure East
Asia region to Azure China East region. The toolkit will sync your metadata and
configuration between the source and the destination subscriptions, so that
everything will be the same as the original after the migration has been
completed. Moreover, the PowerShell scripts generated by the tool can be freely
customized or integrated into your existing DevOps process.

## Installation

###MSI Installer

1. Download latest [MSI Installer](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionToolkit/releases/download/0.2.0/AzureGlobalConnectionToolkit.0.2.0.msi) .
2. Run and Install.

You can also find all the previous releases in [Azure Global Connection Toolkit Release](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionToolkit/releases)

## Get Started

###Assessment Tool

After installation, run cmdlet in your PowerShell.

```powershell
New-AzureRmMigrationReport -TargetEnvironment AzureChinaCloud 
```

After executing the cmdlet, it will follow the steps to generate report:

1. Ask your credential.
2. Select reference subscription.
3. Generate the report.

###CICD Tool

After installation, run cmdlet in your PowerShell if you want to perform a migration.

```powershell
Start-AzureRmVMMigration
```

Run cmdlet if you only want to validate.

```powershell
Start-AzureRmVMMigration -JobType Validate
```

After executing the cmdlet, it will follow the steps to perform VM migration:

1. Ask your source credential.
2. Select source subscription.
3. Ask your destination credential.
4. Select destination subscription.
5. Select the VM to migrate.
6. Select the VM destination location.
7. Check the rename information. 
8. Confirm the VM Migration.
9. Start the VM Migration.

## Known Issue

If you are using the GUI for CICD tool input in PowerShell ISE environment, the window will freeze occasionally. This is because of some issues between PowerShell ISE and WinForm. Please use PowerShell (not ISE) instead if you encounter this issue.

## More Guidance

If you target to investigate Azure in China, we highly recommend to browse [Azure China Playbook](https://aka.ms/azurechinaplaybook). Azure China Playbook contains the answers of FAQ when users consider to migrate or start using Azure in China.
